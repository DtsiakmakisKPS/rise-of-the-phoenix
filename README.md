## Overview

Welcome to **Rise of the Phoenix**! This is a real-time multiplayer game where players compete to find and secure available seats within a dynamic office environment. The game features chair randomization each round, NPC interactions, and smooth player movements facilitated by Phaser.js and Socket.io.
Play the live game [here](https://rise-of-the-phoenix.up.railway.app/).
## Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Connect and play with multiple players simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Chair Allocation:** Chairs are randomized each round to ensure a fresh gameplay experience.
- **NPC Interactions:** Non-player characters (NPCs) occupy taken chairs, enhancing the game's realism.
- **Responsive Controls:** Intuitive player movement using keyboard inputs (WASD and arrow keys).
- **Game Phases:** Pre-game lobby, active gameplay, and game break phases to manage the game's flow.
- **Visual Feedback:** Players receive visual cues when they win or when the game resets.
- **Collision Detection:** Accurate collision handling between players, chairs, and walls.
- **HUD (Heads-Up Display):** Displays game status, timers, and feedback messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Phaser.js:** A fast, robust, and versatile 2D game framework for making HTML5 games.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the game interface.
- **Prettier:** Code formatter to maintain consistent code style.

## Code Structure

### Client-Side (`public/main.js`)

This file manages the main game scenes using Phaser.js. It handles player creation, movement, chair and NPC interactions, and listens for server events to update the game state.

**Key Components:**

- **GameScene Class:**
  - Manages the primary game logic, including player and NPC management, collision handling, and game phase transitions.
  - Handles user input for movement and animations.
  - Communicates with the server to emit and listen for events like player movements and chair acquisitions.

- **HUD Class:**
  - Manages the Heads-Up Display, showing game status, timers, and feedback messages.
  - Listens to events from the `GameScene` to update the HUD accordingly.

- **Helper Functions:**
  - `capitalize(str)`: Capitalizes the first letter of a given string, used for loading sprite assets.


### Server-Side (`server/index.js`)

Handles server-side logic including player connections, disconnections, movement updates, and game phase transitions. Utilizes Socket.io for real-time communication with clients.

**Key Components:**

- **Player Management:**
  - Manages connected players, including adding and removing players upon connection and disconnection.

- **Game Phases:**
  - Controls the game loop with different phases: Pre-Game, Game, and Game Break.
  - Integrates with the `GameLoop` class to manage phase durations and transitions.

- **Event Handling:**
  - Listens for client events like `playerJoined`, `playerMovement`, and `chairFound` to update game state and broadcast changes.
